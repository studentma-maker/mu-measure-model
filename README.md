## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a model and method to measure the **friction coefficient (μ)** of a **belt pulley** system, which is commonly used in mechanical transmission scenarios. The measurement results are useful for analyzing energy losses, wear, and control precision in belt-driven systems.
